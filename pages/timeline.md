## Collection Timeline

This is a feature that we're looking forward to using! On the non-prototype version of the site, we plan to identify the "dates" associated with each story as closely as possible to when the events occurred. At the moment, they are still using the dates from the Document Site, which align instead with the litigation and recording dates from the colonial documents. While we hope to configure some strategy to be able to denote multiple dates for a single story on the timeline, either because the story has multiple documents or has multiple differently-dated occurences in the same document, for now we have added the date of the earliest document.
