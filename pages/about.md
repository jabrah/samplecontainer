## About the Project

### Project Overview

In fall of 2020, Dr. Jessica Marie Johnson planted the seed for this project, bringing together a group of graduate student researchers to start looking into records from French and Spanish Colonial Louisiana that the Louisiana Historical Center has recently digitized. That digitization effort represented an incredible feat in making the documents available to researchers, but there remained references to Black people in Louisiana that the "search" functions overlooked, and important contextualizations that lay beyond the scope of that project. Our goal was to find these individuals and their stories, describe their significance using "keywords," and make transcription of the hard-to-read handwriting and English translations of those transcriptions.  

Our project aims to bring these stories to a broad audience of descendats, teachers, students, creatives, community members, and scholars. Over time, our team has grown to include scholars at various career levels - from undergraduates to full professors - and across numerous institutions. We also began a robust program of community engagement, working with public historians, cultural workers, educators, and descendants as advisors to the project.  

Following the links below, you can learn more about the scope and goals of the project as well as our research, transcription, translation, digitization, and community engagement processes. You can also meet our team and our partners. [Read more.](/keywords/overview)  

### How we do what we do

We started out with a giant database of digitized manuscript documents, and our goal is to have a comprehensive subset of these documents transcribed, translated, and published on this website. How do get there? Choosing documents, collaborating on challenging transcriptions and translations, annotating those texts, working through a rigorous editorial process, and putting the texts and original images on a website are the essential technical steps in our process. We also work closely with our community team to ensure that we work ethically and effectively to create an impactful project. Learn more about the nuts and bolts of our approach here.

### Our Team

Keywords for Black Louisiana is a collective of researchers founded in 2020 with the goal of creating new routes through the archive that make central the lived experiences of Black people in colonial Louisiana. As historians, we are invested in the rigorous, accurate, and detailed transcription of archival materials for the benefit of researchers and the broader public. As digital humanists, we are also committed to ethical scholarship rooted in reciprocity and community accountability. Therefore, our project challenges and confronts the archival silences and technological limitations that traditionally obscure Black life and humanity throughout Louisiana history.

### Our Partners

We work with New Orleans-based community partners in professional fields ranging from public history, education, literature, art, and activism. [Meet our partners](/keywords/partners)

## About Keywords  
Keywords are the boats we use to navigate the ocean that is slavery’s archive. We define keywords as the simplest encapsulation of a topic that we have identified as salient to Black life and resistance to slavery.[^1] The colonial Louisiana archive is massive. The documents transcribed and translated for this micro-edition are housed at the Louisiana Historical Center (LHC). The LHC, part of the Louisiana State Museum and housed in the New Orleans Jazz Museum (all institutional partners), is home to two-thirds of the colonial documents relating to the French Superior Council and Spanish Cabildo. Approximately another three-fifths of Louisiana’s colonial documents are housed at the New Orleans Notarial Archives and a smaller subset is preserved by the City Archives at the New Orleans Public Library.[^2] Although the full number of colonial documents remains unclear, the Louisiana Colonial Digitization Project, which claims to have digitized all of the extant documents held by the Louisiana Historical Center, holds approximately two hundred thousand documents related to colonial Louisiana. If this is two-thirds of the documentation on colonial Louisiana, there are over half a million documents related to the eighteenth-century Gulf Coast held in archives across New Orleans. Additional material is available in the parish and county archives across the state, in France, Senegal, Florida, Washington, D.C. and across the Caribbean.  

We use keywords to teach, draw attention to, and challenge the documented narrative about Black people. Much of the information in the colonial documents is not specific to Africans and people of African descent. Even where enslaved and free people of color are mentioned, their complicated humanities are not always legible in the narratives told about them by enslavers. Keywords allow us to “designate collective thoughts, ideas, arguments, and experiences that might otherwise stand alone or be quickly subsumed.”  

In the digital form of this micro-edition, keywords, like hashtags, become data about Black life in Gulf Coast Louisiana, and the African diaspora broadly. They offer a machine-readable node of information that provides “a searchable shortcut that can link people and ideas together.”[^3] Employing keywords as an alternative form of structuring the massive textual and non-textual information found in the colonial archive, allows us to draw readers attention to the parts of documents that feature individuals and community of African descent and reorient readers engagement with the document much of it allows us to recover the stories of enslaved and free Black and Black-Native people that have been buried beneath the enslaver-centered testimony in colonial archives.  


## About the Story Set  
The Story Set is the next step in remixing the archive. Rather than making the base unit of our data presentation the documents, as is the case in the colonial archive, we put stories of Black and Black Native life front and center. Each story is a narrative exposition of one or a few documents that fit together to give a more comprehensive view of individuals, relations, and experiences in colonial Louisiana. While this verison is very much a draft, in the future, the metadata will change to underscore our commitment to bringing the audience into the time and place of when events occurred, rather than when they were litigated in the courts. The site will also strive to bring the historical actors, characters of a sort, to the fore through bringing out as much biographical information as possible, and kinship and community relationships.
