kl001,hypolite.jpeg,,,Hypolite Seeks Care,,1744,"For eight months, an enslaved man named Hypolite experienced painful symptoms of a condition that made it difficult for him to breathe, eat, and labor for his enslavers. In the documents that follow, we learn that Hypolite's enslaver valued profit over Hypolite's health and life. His enslaver sold him, citing the costs of his care as the reason for the sale. This document consists of three parts. First, we see the enslaver's request to sell Hypolite. Next, we see the colonial administration approve that request. Lastly, the third section of the document captures the public auction that took place eight days later, in front of the parish church, where another enslaver purchased Hypolite.",wellness; healthcare; succession; lease; wellness; illness; sale; auction; slave auction,,,,,,,image/jpeg,fr,,
kl002,dominique.jpeg,,,Chef Dominique and Family Stay Together,,1744-12-16,"Kinship, as theorized by historians of slavery and experienced in daily life past and present, takes many forms. While the actions of enslavers who bought and sold human beings with little attention to parental, sibling, or other relationships tore families apart, here we have an example of eight enslaved people who managed to stay together in face of the devastating financial logic that marked transactions in individuals. This document offers a glimpse into the family life and professional training of an enslaved man named Dominique and his kin. We glimpse Marianne, who is married to Dominique, and learn the names of their five children—Hypolite, Louis, Joseph, Anne, François—and one grandchild, Claude, who is Hypolite's son. This story is also remarkable in what it suggests about Dominique's profession. We learn that he is, by trade, a chef who has been living in France—presumably an early example of enslaved men who were brought to that country to train in the classical style of French cuisine. According to this record, Dominique was so accomplished that his enslaver wished to bring him from France to serve at the King of Spain's court before Dominique returned to Louisiana.",kinship; transportation; contract labor,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0011.html,,,image/jpeg,fr,,
