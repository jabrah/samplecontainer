s001,charity.jpeg,,,Hypolite Seeks Care,,1744,"For eight months, an enslaved man named Hypolite experienced painful symptoms of a condition that made it difficult for him to breathe, eat, and labor for his enslavers. In the documents that follow, we learn that Hypolite's enslaver valued profit over Hypolite's health and life. His enslaver sold him, citing the costs of his care as the reason for the sale. This document consists of three parts. First, we see the enslaver's request to sell Hypolite. Next, we see the colonial administration approve that request. Lastly, the third section of the document captures the public auction that took place eight days later, in front of the parish church, where another enslaver purchased Hypolite. There were limited institutional options within colonial Louisiana medical care for Africans and their descendents. Sometimes enslavers consulted plantation or colonial doctors, such as Mr. Prat, the King's Doctor, whose words we read in this record. While we may assume Prat treated Hypolite, we witness how Prat's confirmation of Hypolite's sickness served as certification for Hypolite's enslaver, who then could justify the sale of Hypolite to colonial officials. Enslaved people occasionally received care at the public hospital,'L'Hôpital des Pauvres de la Charité,' or Charity Hospital, which opened a few years before Hypolite became sick. Enslaved and free Black men, women, and children such as Marie Aram and François Tiocou (who are mentioned elsewhere in this edition) worked in the hospital providing care for other Black, Indigenous, and Afro-Indigenous people in the colony. Enslaved people relied on their communities and healers, often women, who had knowledge of herbal and medicinal practices. These practices were rooted in African and Indigenous sacred knowledge systems, traditions, and techniques passed down over generations. Before his enslaver sold Hypolite, colonial officials advertised for his sale. This document confirms that the advertisement was posted and that the public auction would occur on that day, January 29th 1741. We learn little from this record about the eight days Hypolite spent between the approval of his sale and when he was sold. Who cared for and comforted him? How might we imagine that he and his community on the Coustilhas plantation took care of one another in the wake of this news?",wellness; health; care; succession; lease; illness; sale; auction; slave auction,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0072.html; https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0073.html; https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0074.html,,,image/jpeg,fr,,
s002,map.jpeg,,,Chef Dominique and Family Stay Together,,1744-12-16,"Kinship, as theorized by historians of slavery and experienced in daily life past and present, takes many forms. While the actions of enslavers who bought and sold human beings with little attention to parental, sibling, or other relationships tore families apart, here we have an example of eight enslaved people who managed to stay together in face of the devastating financial logic that marked transactions in individuals. This document offers a glimpse into the family life and professional training of an enslaved man named Dominique and his kin. We glimpse Marianne, who is married to Dominique, and learn the names of their five children—Hypolite, Louis, Joseph, Anne, François—and one grandchild, Claude, who is Hypolite's son. This story is also remarkable in what it suggests about Dominique's profession. We learn that he is, by trade, a chef who has been living in France—presumably an early example of enslaved men who were brought to that country to train in the classical style of French cuisine. According to this record, Dominique was so accomplished that his enslaver wished to bring him from France to serve at the King of Spain's court before Dominique returned to Louisiana.",kinship; transportation; contract labor,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0011.html,,,image/jpeg,fr,,

s004,church.jpeg,,,Mama Comba’s Gombeaux,,1764-09-04,"In Africans in Colonial Louisiana, Dr. Gwendolyn Midlo Hall argues this document offers the first Gulf Coast reference to gumbo ('un Gombeau') in the archive. This is the testimony of Mama 'Julie' Comba, a fifty year old negresse and African woman [nation Mandinga] who lived in the Hospital for the Poor [Hospital de Pauvres] and was enslaved to the Capuchin priests. Mama Comba appears before the French Superior Council in this, her second interrogation, as a result of the arrest of two runaways, the nègre Cezar, and the nègre Louis also called Foy (dit Foy). The runaways were caught and accused of murder, but ultimately charged with public drunkenness, theft and firing weapons into the air (no one was killed) and with being fugitives. Mama Comba was interrogated because she hosted a feast that Cezar and Louis were guests at, bringing with them a pig that Louis allegedly stole and that the guests all took part in cooking and eating. The document below is drawn from part of Mama Comba’s testimony.",marronage; kinship; labor; fugitivity; rival geography; play,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0137.html,,,image/jpeg,fr,,
s006,map.jpeg,,,Catherina's Value,,1773-06-25,"The shift from French to Spanish dominion brought with it new laws, new customs, and new strategies for enslaved resistance. In 1773, Catherina, enslaved on the Destrehan Plantation, claimed her freedom based on a new system of manumission that came to be called coartación. Coartación was a system of manumission through purchase that allowed enslaved women, children and men to force their owners to enter into agreements with them that set a purchase price they could pay down to acquire manumission. Catherina, one of the earliest of these cases, pursued manumission in this exact fashion. A few things are important to note in her story. First, throughout the case, Catherina argued for and defended her right to a lower self-purchase price based on an unspecified infirmity. How the participants reacted to her claims of disability is of interest to anyone studying the history of disability and how it intersects with race, gender, and bodnage. Second, the slaveowner of note in this case is none other than Étienne de Boré, the man known in the history of United States slavery as the innovator of sugar cultivation in lower Louisiana. This makes Catherina’s case a critical part of the history of the plantation in the United States. Third, Catherina is not arguing just for herself in her battle for freedom–included in her claim is her five year old daughter, Felicité. Once again, kinship remains the tie that binds and sustains, inspiring resistance, refusals, and challenges that might have been impossible to imagine otherwise.",valuation; self-purchase; coartación; womanhood; childhood; kinship; disability; succession; motherhood,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0218.html,,,image/jpeg,sp,,
s007,map.jpeg,,,"Camarades Fanchon, Antoine, and Vulcain Escape from a Plantation below New Orleans to Havana, Cuba",,1739-11-07,"In the mid 1730s, the Superior Council mandated that enslavers must record in the Registry when those they enslaved ran away. As a result, the colonial archive created during and after the mid 1730s offers us vast examples of enslaved Africans and their descendants who fled plantations throughout Louisiana. While the declaration of their escape was recorded, the paper trail often ends there, leaving us to wonder where those who escaped fled to, who they escaped with, and what happened after their initial flight. The following excerpts from three different documents within the colonial archive offer a rare exception. Here, we learn that for a period of almost a decade, enslaver Joseph Chaperon hunted three Senegambians who fled his plantation during the height of the Chickasaw Wars. Fanchon, of the Senegal nation, her husband Antoine, Bambara, and their comrade Vulcain, also Bambara, who had a physical disability, escaped together in July 1739, last seen with a Spanish mulatre enslaved to Monsieur Gonzalez, who stole a pirogue to help facilitate their flight. Five years later in 1744, enslaver Joseph Chaperon granted power of attorney to enslaver Destrehan, who was embarking for Cuba on personal business, to hunt Fanchon, Antoine, and Vulcain who were spotted in Cuba. From the archive, we learn that Fanchon, Antoine, and Vulcain thwarted all enslavers’ efforts to capture them for at least the next four years. In 1748, other fugitives captured in Havana and brought back to New Orleans told their enslavers that although Fanchon had passed away by that point in 1748, Antoine worked in the woods outside Havana and Vulcain sold beer in the city.",marronage; kinship; disability; transportation; collaboration; fugitivity; rival geography,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0127.html; https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0128.html; https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0129.html,,,image/jpeg,fr,,
s008,charity.jpeg,,,Baptiste is Freed by the Spanish Governor,,1790-05-04,"Many of Louisiana’s colonial elites had a vested personal interest in maintaining the institution of Indian slavery. After the death of Lieutenant Governor Francisco de Cruzat (1775-78 & 1780-87), two freedom suits were brought against his heirs by his Native slaves, Pierre Morsu and Marie Paget. Born into slavery along with their Black-Native half-brother, Baptiste Bourguignon, all three siblings successfully sued for their freedom. When deposed before Don Rafael Perdomo, Baptiste testified his mother was 'una India natural dela nación Chise [Chickasaw]' and that he “knew the pains of slavery.' Evidence suggests the Indian slave trade between Upper and Lower Louisiana continued during the Spanish period. Baptiste had been sold upriver only two years prior, in 1788, by his former enslaver, Madame LeFleur of New Orleans, to Don Manuel Bourgignon of Ste. Geneviève, the region from which his mother, Catalina, had originated. Notarial records show that the executor of Cruzat’s estate was ordered to issue cartas of emancipation for all three of her children due to this. The cases of Pierre v. Cruzat Heirs (1790) and Baptiste v. Bourguignon (1790) are particularly noteworthy because they represent the first attempts by Native and Black-Native people to use the Spanish courts to challenge the legality of their enslavement under Spanish law before Indian freedom suits were outlawed by Gov. Carondelet in 1794. Furthermore, they prove Lt. Gov. Cruzat himself had made no attempt to free any of the Native people he personally held in bondage after the issuance of O’Reilly’s Proclamation of 1769, which supposedly banned the practice. And Cruzat’s was not an isolated example.",freedom suit; manumission; Indian slavery; mixed-race; kinship; race; Afro-Indigeneity,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0005.html,,,image/jpeg,sp,,
s009,church.jpeg,,,Jannot Testifies in the Case of the Disappearance of Enslaver Corbin,,1743-09-10,"Beginning mid-sentence, this document comprises the second half of the formal interrogation of a thirty seven year old enslaved man of the Bambara nation named Jannot. The case revolves around the disappearance of an enslaver named Corbin, who lived near Jannot and Jannot’s enslaver Leonard southeast of New Orleans at English Turn. After another enslaver claimed he overheard Jannot say that he knew who killed Corbin, colonial administrators imprisoned Jannot and began their interrogation. During this questioning, Jannot recounts the violence and threats that he and his unnamed wife endured from both his enslaver Leonard and Leonard’s wife. Additionally, we learn from Jannot’s testimony about a gathering of Africans and their descendents that occurred two months before Corbin’s disappearance, where Jannot tells the Superior Council that people of the Fon nation sang songs that he could not understand. Spiritual songs sung in Fon (Nigeria, Benin, Togo) will not be mutually intelligible to someone of the Bambara nation (Senegambia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire). However this linguistic/ethnic distinction is rendered insignificant to enslavers questioning Jannot, who refer to these songs as ""des chansons Negres."" Significantly, the mention in this document of spiritual or religious practices as well as spiritual songs sung in Fon potentially demonstrates some of the earliest evidence in the Louisiana colonial archive of Africans and their descendents’ practices of voodoo. We also learn from Jannot about other enslaved and maroon Africans that participated in the gathering, as well as his own experience running away for 8 days to escape abuses from his enslavers. Officials’ questions and Jannot’s answers illuminate colonial fears about the power of enslaved and free Black community gathering, including their attempts to downplay their anxieties by calling the gathering a 'badinage,' or 'playful banter' while panicked to learn from Jannot all that occurred at it.",religion; marronage; rival geography; conspiracy; song; fugitivity,,,,https://lxcprojects.github.io/keywords/keywords/d0335.html,,,image/jpeg,fr,,
